    "　　It is an approach that can simplify more complex matrix operations that can be performed on the decomposed matrix rather than on the original matrix itself.\n",
    "  \n",
    "A common analogy for matrix decomposition is the factoring 因式分解 of numbers, such as the factoring of 25 into 5 x 5. For this reason, matrix decomposition is also called matrix factorization. Like factoring real values, there are many ways to decompose a matrix, hence there are a range of different matrix decomposition techniques."

However, for certain systems and algorithms, complete pivoting (or maximal pivoting) may be required for acceptable accuracy. Complete pivoting interchanges交换 both rows and columns in order to use the largest (by absolute value) element in the matrix as the pivot. \n",
